          <h2>FTC Compliance Statement</h2>
          <p>
            In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, {siteName} 
            discloses that we may receive financial compensation when you click on certain 
            links and make purchases from our retail partners.

          <h2>How Affiliate Marketing Works</h2>
          
          <h3>What Are Affiliate Links?</h3>
          <p>
            Affiliate links are special URLs that contain tracking codes. When you click on 
            these links and make a purchase, the merchant pays us a small commission at no 
            additional cost to you.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Why We Use Affiliate Marketing</h3>
          <p>
            Affiliate commissions help us:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep our platform free for all users</li>
            <li>Pay for hosting, development, and maintenance costs</li>
            <li>Compensate our team and moderators</li>
            <li>Invest in new features and improvements</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>How Links Are Marked</h3>
          <p>
            We clearly identify affiliate relationships through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Sponsored" or "Affiliate" labels on links</li>
            <li>Disclosure notices near affiliate content</li>
            <li>This dedicated disclosure page</li>
            <li>Proper HTML rel attributes (rel="sponsored")</li>
          </ul>
